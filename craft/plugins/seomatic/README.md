A turnkey SEO implementation for Craft CMS that is comprehensive, powerful, and flexible.

## Installation

To install SEOmatic, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `seomatic` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require nystudio107/seomatic`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `seomatic` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

SEOmatic works on Craft 2.4.x, Craft 2.5.x, and Craft 2.6.x.

## Overview

SEOmatic allows you to quickly get a website up and running with a robust, comprehensive SEO strategy.  It is also implemented in a Craft-y way, in that it is also flexible and customizable.

It implements [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld?hl=en) microdata, [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org) core metadata, [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) tags, [Facebook OpenGraph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph) tags, [Humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org) authorship accreditation, and as well as HTML meta tags.

The general philosophy is that SEO Site Meta can be overridden by SEO Template Meta, which can be overridden by SEO Entry Meta, which can be overridden by dynamic SEO Twig tags.

In this way, the SEO Meta tags on your site cascade, so that they are globally available, but also can be customized in a very granular way.

SEOmatic populates your templates with SEO Meta in the same way that Craft populates your templates with `entry` variables, with a similar level of freedom and flexibility in terms of how you utilize them.

SEOmatic also caches each unique SEO Meta request so that your website performance is minimally impacted by the rich SEO Meta tags provided.

## Documentation

Please read the complete documentation in the [SEOmatic Wiki](https://github.com/nystudio107/seomatic/wiki) or read the `DOCS.md` file in the repo.

To better understand how all of this metadata benefits your website, please read: [Promote Your Content with Structured Data Markup](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/)

If you need to redirect from legacy URLs to preserve SEO value when rebuilding & restructuring a website, check out the [Retour Plugin](https://github.com/nystudio107/retour)

## Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

* [bug] Get the Template Metas implemented with full `locale` support, so the settings can all be per-locale based
* [bug] Enforce *required fields on the various settings pages in the Admin CP by doing proper validation
* [bug] The `foundingDate` fields probably should be dateTimeField types on the Settings pages
* [feature] Add support for `og:image:type`, `og:image:width`, and `og:image:height`
* [feature] Add the ability to analyze a page for content vs. keywords for the SEO Template Metas, "just like Yoast"
* [feature] Change the preview to a live preview when editing things in SEOmatic
* [feature] Provide SiteMap functionality.  Yes, it's SEO-related, but seems like it might be better to keep SEOmatic focused (?)
